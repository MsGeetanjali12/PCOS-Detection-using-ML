# PCOS Detection Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder affecting women, leading to irregular menstrual cycles, excessive androgen levels, acne, and infertility. Early detection is crucial for effective management.  

This project utilizes **machine learning** to predict PCOS based on medical and hormonal data. Various classification algorithms, including **Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression**, were implemented for accurate diagnosis.  

## Dataset  
- A publicly available dataset containing hormonal and reproductive health indicators was used.  
- Features include hormone levels, menstrual cycle details, and other relevant factors.  

## Methodology  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- **Best Model:** Random Forest classifier achieved **89% accuracy**  
- **Cross-validation Score:** 88.51%, ensuring no significant overfitting  

## Key Findings  
- The Random Forest model provided the highest accuracy.  
- The model can assist in early PCOS detection and diagnosis.
